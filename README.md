# Tweepy-Flask
Flask backend and Twitter API Library (Tweepy)
This python script displays the tweets made by the entered twitter handle or desired hashtag on your browser.
I further intend to implement sentiment analysis of tweets.

Just open command prompt, go inside the folder Tweepy and run it on your localhost server.
Enjoy the feed!
